# SYDE522 Final Project
Implemenentation of DQN training using PyTorch (uses a bit of starter code from https://github.com/berkeleydeeprlcourse/homework)

Exploration of various algorithms and implementations starting from what was presented in https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~vmnih/docs/dqn.pdf. 

Additionally exploring the impact of learning with multiple parallel agents, and other to be determined enchancements.
